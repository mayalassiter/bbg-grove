Steps to run the code for basic sensors

1.	led_blink.py
	- This is the basic led blinking code.
	- Connect the grove LED sensor to the UART port of the BBG.
	- The LED turns on and off for 100ms. This time can be changed by changing the value inside the function time.sleep()
	- To run it : $ python led_blink.py
	- To stop the program press Ctrl+C

2.	simple_button.py
	- Connect the grove button sensor to the UART port of the BBG
	- This code takes in the button press as input and prints the output as “Button press”
	- If the button is not pressed, a counter is incremented and the count is displayed on the console screen.
	- To run the program: $ python simple_button.py
	- To end the program press Ctrl+C

3.	adc_sound.py
	- The grove sound sensor can be connected to the I2C port of the BBG using the grove I2C_ADC sensor.
	- Connect the J1 port of the I2C_ADC sensor to the I2C port of the BBG and connect the J2 port of it to the grove sound sensor.
	- Connect the grove LED sensor to the UART port of the BBG
	- The code displays – ‘sound detected’ on the console screen as well as lights on the LED for a short period of time else it is turned off.
	- To run the code: $ python adc_sound.py
	- To end the program press Ctrl+C

4.	adc_light.py
	- The grove light sensor can be connected to the I2C port of the BBG using the grove I2C_ADC sensor.
	- Connect the J1 port of the I2C_ADC sensor to the I2C port of the BBG and connect the J2 port of it to the grove light sensor.
	- Connect the grove LED sensor to the UART port of the BBG
	- The grove light sensor detects light and turns on the grove LED sensor. When the light sensor is placed in the dark, it turns off the LED 
	- To run the code: $ python adc_light.py
	- To end the program press Ctrl+C

5.	rotary_sensor.py
	- The rotary sensor also uses the grove I2C_ADC sensor. Connect the J2 port of the grove I2C_ADC sensor to the grove rotary sensor and the J1 port to the I2C port of the BBG
	- Connect the grove LED sensor to the UART port of the BBG.
	- The values of angle of rotation can be seen on the console screen as the knob of the rotary sensor is moved.
	- When the knob of the rotary sensor is moved to its highest value, the LED turns on.
	- To run the program: $ python rotary_sensor.py
	- To stop the program press Ctrl+C
